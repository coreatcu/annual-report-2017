But over just the past two years, it has expanded into becoming one of the most successful student-run accelerators in the country, seeing an Almaworks startup enter Y Combinator and go on to raise a 3.1MM seed round from investors such as KPCB, FundersClub, and many prominent angel investors. Our latest cohort of seven student startups engaged in a nine week intensive program which connected founders with mentors who could teach necessary and proven skills, and included founders tackling challenges in spaces such as hospitality marketing, fantasy sports, and hangover cures.",
